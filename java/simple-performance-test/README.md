Download the sample app and navigate into the app directory:

1.  Clone the [Cloud Bigtable examples repository][github-repo], to your local
    machine:

        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-bigtable-examples.git

    Alternatively, you can [download the sample][github-zip] as a zip file and
    extract it.

## Costs

This sample uses billable components of Cloud Platform, including:

+   Google Cloud Bigtable

Use the [Pricing Calculator][bigtable-pricing] to generate a cost estimate
based on your projected usage.  New Cloud Platform users might be eligible for
a [free trial][free-trial].

## Before you begin

This sample assumes you have [Java 8][java8] installed.

[java8]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

### Installing Maven

These samples use the [Apache Maven][maven] build system. Before getting
started, be sure to [download][maven-download] and [install][maven-install] it.
When you use Maven as described here, it will automatically download the needed
client libraries.

[maven]: https://maven.apache.org
[maven-download]: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
[maven-install]: https://maven.apache.org/install.html

### Creating a Project in the Google Cloud Platform Console

If you haven't already created a project, create one now. Projects enable you to
manage all Google Cloud Platform resources for your app, including deployment,
access control, billing, and services.

1. Open the [Cloud Platform Console][cloud-console].
1. In the drop-down menu at the top, select **Create a project**.
1. Give your project a name.
1. Make a note of the project ID, which might be different from the project
   name. The project ID is used in commands and in configurations.

[cloud-console]: https://console.cloud.google.com/

### Enabling billing for your project.

If you haven't already enabled billing for your project, [enable
billing][enable-billing] now.  Enabling billing allows is required to use Cloud Bigtable
and to create VM instances.

[enable-billing]: https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/settings

### Install the Google Cloud SDK.

If you haven't already installed the Google Cloud SDK, [install the Google
Cloud SDK][cloud-sdk] now. The SDK contains tools and libraries that enable you
to create and manage resources on Google Cloud Platform.

[cloud-sdk]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

### Setting Google Application Default Credentials

Set your [Google Application Default
Credentials][application-default-credentials] by [initializing the Google Cloud
SDK][cloud-sdk-init] with the command:

		gcloud init

Or with the [application-default login](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/auth/application-default/login) command:

    gcloud auth application-default login

[cloud-sdk-init]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing
[application-default-credentials]: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials

## Provisioning an instance

Follow the instructions in the [user
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/creating-instance) to
create a Google Cloud Platform project and Cloud Bigtable instance if necessary.
You'll need to reference your project id and instance id to run the
application.

## Running the application


    mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.bigtable.simpleperf.WritePerfTest" -Dexec.args="[project id] [instance id] [table] [row count] [value size]


## Cleaning up

To avoid incurring extra charges to your Google Cloud Platform account, remove
the resources created for this sample.

1.  Go to the Cloud Bigtable Instances page in the [Cloud
    Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

    [Go to the Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/bigtable/instances)

1.  Click the instance name.

1.  Click **Delete**.

    ![Delete](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/img/delete-quickstart-instance.png)

1. Type the instance ID, then click **Delete** to delete the instance.
