## Downloading the sample

Download the sample app and navigate into the app directory:

1.  Clone the [Cloud Bigtable examples repository][github-repo], to your local
    machine:

        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-bigtable-examples.git

    Alternatively, you can [download the sample][github-zip] as a zip file and
    extract it.

2.  Change to the Hello World code sample directory.

        cd cloud-bigtable-examples/java/quickstart

## Costs

This sample uses billable components of Cloud Platform, including:

+   Google Cloud Bigtable

Use the [Pricing Calculator][bigtable-pricing] to generate a cost estimate
based on your projected usage.  New Cloud Platform users might be eligible for
a [free trial][free-trial].

## Before you begin

This sample assumes you have [Java 8][java8] installed.

[java8]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

### Installing Maven

These samples use the [Apache Maven][maven] build system. Before getting
started, be sure to [download][maven-download] and [install][maven-install] it.
When you use Maven as described here, it will automatically download the needed
client libraries.

[maven]: https://maven.apache.org
[maven-download]: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
[maven-install]: https://maven.apache.org/install.html

### Creating a Project in the Google Cloud Platform Console

If you haven't already created a project, create one now. Projects enable you to
manage all Google Cloud Platform resources for your app, including deployment,
access control, billing, and services.

1. Open the [Cloud Platform Console][cloud-console].
1. In the drop-down menu at the top, select **Create a project**.
1. Give your project a name.
1. Make a note of the project ID, which might be different from the project
   name. The project ID is used in commands and in configurations.

[cloud-console]: https://console.cloud.google.com/

### Enabling billing for your project.

If you haven't already enabled billing for your project, [enable
billing][enable-billing] now.  Enabling billing is required to use Cloud Bigtable
and other operations like creating VM instances.

[enable-billing]: https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/settings

### Enable the Cloud Bigtable API

  [Enable the Cloud Bigtable API][enable_api].

  Note: The quickstart performs an operation on an existing table.
  If you require your code to create instances or tables,
  the [Admin API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=bigtableadmin.googleapis.com)
  must be enabled as well.

### Authentication

  [Set up authentication with a service account][auth] so you can access the API from your local workstation.

### Install the Google Cloud SDK

https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-bigtable-examples/blob/424aa3526cdab2e116a6b79e6a8a1c087cfa4b37/java/hello-world/src/main/java/com/example/cloud/bigtable/helloworld/HelloWorld.java#L69-L78

## Quickstart

### Before you begin

1.  Select or create a Cloud Platform project.

    [Go to the projects page][projects]

1.  Enable billing for your project.

    [Enable billing][billing]





[projects]: https://console.cloud.google.com/project
[billing]: https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing

## Provisioning an instance

Follow the instructions in the [user
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/creating-instance) to
create a Google Cloud Platform project and Cloud Bigtable instance if necessary.
You'll need to reference your project id and instance id to run the
application.


## Running the application

Build and run the sample using Maven.

    mvn package
    mvn exec:java -Dbigtable.projectID=GCLOUDPROJECT -Dbigtable.instanceID=BIGTABLEINSTANCE

You will see output resembling the following, interspersed with informational logging
from the underlying libraries:

    HelloWorld: Create table Hello-Bigtable
    HelloWorld: Write some greetings to the table
    HelloWorld: Scan for all greetings:
        Hello World!
        Hello Cloud Bigtable!
        Hello HBase!
    HelloWorld: Delete the table


## Cleaning up

To avoid incurring extra charges to your Google Cloud Platform account, remove
the resources created for this sample.

1.  Go to the [Cloud Bigtable instance page](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/bigtable/instances) in the Cloud Console.

1.  Click on the instance name.

1.  Click **Delete instance**.

    ![Delete](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/img/delete-quickstart-instance.png)

1. Type the instance ID, then click **Delete** to delete the instance.
